## Advanced Configuration (KCP Modes)
In **Step 8 (External server)** and **Step 9 (Iran server)**, you can choose different configuration modes.

### KCP Modes
0. **normal** – Normal speed, normal latency, low resource usage  
1. **fast** – Balanced speed, low latency, normal resource usage  
2. **fast2** – High speed, lower latency, moderate resource usage  
3. **fast3** – Maximum speed, very low latency, high CPU usage  
4. **manual** – Advanced manual configuration

> **Recommendation:**  
> Based on feedback from current users, **option 1 (fast)** provides the best overall experience for most setups.
If your **Iran server has network or resource limitations**, it is recommended to test different modes to determine which one works best for your environment.
If you have sufficient **experience and technical knowledge**, you can use **manual mode** to fully customize all settings.

## Network Optimization (Optional)
Run the script:
```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/behzadea12/Paqet-Tunnel-Manager/main/paqet-manager.sh)
````

Select **option 7**, then choose one of the following:
1. **BBR** – TCP congestion control optimizer *(recommended for external servers)*
2. **DNS Finder** – Find the best DNS servers for Iran *(recommended for Iran servers)*
3. **Mirror Selector** – Find the fastest APT repository mirror *(recommended for Iran servers)*

### Included Tools
- **[BBR – TCP Congestion Control Optimizer](https://github.com/teddysun/across/)**
- **[IranDNSFinder – Finds and configures optimal DNS servers](https://github.com/alinezamifar/IranDNSFinder)**
- **[DetectUbuntuMirror – Selects the fastest APT mirror (Ubuntu/Debian only)](https://github.com/alinezamifar/DetectUbuntuMirror)**



## Troubleshooting: Paqet Installation Issues

If Paqet fails to install automatically during configuration  
(i.e. you see "Failed to install Paqet" or the script gets stuck when adding a new config in **Server/Kharej** or **Client/Iran** mode), follow these simple steps:

1. **Manually download the Paqet binary**  

   Visit the official releases page:  
   https://github.com/hanselime/paqet/releases

   - Choose the **latest release** (currently `v1.0.0-alpha.13` or newer — always pick the most recent one).  
   - Download the file that matches your server architecture:

     - `paqet-linux-amd64-*.tar.gz` → for most 64-bit servers (x86_64 / amd64)  
     - `paqet-linux-arm64-*.tar.gz` → for ARM-based servers (aarch64 / arm64)

2. **Place the downloaded file in this exact folder**  

   Move or copy the `.tar.gz` file to:

   ```bash
   /root/paqet/
   ```
   If the folder doesn't exist, create it first:
   ```bash
    mkdir -p /root/paqet
   ```

3. Run the manager script again
   The script will automatically detect the file inside /root/paqet/, use it instead of trying to download again, extract it, and complete the installation.
   ```bash
   bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/behzadea12/Paqet-Tunnel-Manager/main/paqet-manager.sh)
   ```
